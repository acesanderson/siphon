You are creating a retrieval-optimized semantic description of a video transcript.

<metadata>{{ metadata }}</metadata>

<transcript>{{ text }}</transcript>

Write a single dense paragraph (5-8 sentences) describing the video content for a knowledge base. State the inferred purpose of the video, characterize the interaction (monologue, interview, demo, etc.), identify specific entities mentioned, and capture main topics, decisions, and outcomes. Use dense declarative prose without formatting. Preserve specific technical terms and keywords.
