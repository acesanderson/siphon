### Purpose of this project

Develop "channels" for given topics, where each channel is a curated list of sources (resources, articles, and tools) related to that topic. 

A channel creates ProcessedContent for each source, which includes a summary, key points, and relevant tags, and is given a special channel tag.

Stages:
- passive collection + browing
- querying
- memory management (a la memgpt, sourdoug)
