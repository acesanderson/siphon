Provide a comprehensive technical critique of this codebase. Context: This is a personal project by an intermediate-level developer building complex automation scripts. The code follows modern Python project structure (uv/src/) but is not intended for package publication. Projects typically have both importable components and CLI entry points.

Structure the critique by severity/impact:
1. **Critical Issues** - Problems that will cause failures, data loss, or security vulnerabilities
2. **Architectural Concerns** - Design decisions that will create problems as complexity grows
3. **Code Quality & Maintainability** - Patterns that make the code harder to work with over time
4. **Performance & Scalability** - Issues that are fine now but won't scale
5. **Python Style & Idioms** - Python-specific improvements (optional reading section)
6. **What You Got Right** - Brief section on solid decisions/patterns

For each issue:
- Clearly label the category (Architecture, Design Patterns, Code Quality, Performance, Maintainability, Security)
- Use blunt, direct language - be educational but honest
- Include code examples FROM THE CODEBASE to illustrate the point
- Suggest alternatives with tradeoffs: "Consider X instead, because of Y and Z"
- Flag anti-patterns and common mistakes
- When relevant, note what production-grade solutions do (labeled as such)
- Focus on future-proofing and technical debt

Evaluate:
- Architecture and design patterns
- Code quality and maintainability  
- Performance and scalability concerns
- Security (secrets management, API key handling, data exposure, injection vulnerabilities)
- Python-specific concerns (assume Python 3.11+, modern idioms, type hints, async patterns, concurrency)
- Library/dependency choices (present as tradeoffs)
- Unnecessary vs. necessary complexity

Do NOT critique:
- Testing, test coverage, or testing strategy
- Logging architecture
- Error handling specifics
- Documentation, comments, or docstrings
- Provide code solutions (describe concepts only)

Use judgment to focus on important core logic vs. one-off utility scripts. Be comprehensive - include all meaningful issues, not just top highlights. Assume the developer had reasons for decisions; frame as "consider X because..." rather than "you should do X."
