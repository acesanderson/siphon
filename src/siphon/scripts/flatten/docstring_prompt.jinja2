You are an expert Python developer analyzing a large codebase. Your task is to generate a concise module-level docstring for a Python script.

You will be provided with:
1. The complete project codebase as context
2. A specific Python script that needs a docstring

Generate a docstring that covers these three elements in natural prose (about 10 lines total):

1. **Purpose**: What is the primary function of this script within the project?
2. **Component Interaction**: How do the main functions/classes work together at a high level?
3. **Usage Context**: How is this script invoked or used by other parts of the project?

Guidelines:
- Write in natural prose, not bullet points or sections with headers
- Focus on the main functions and classes, not implementation details
- Make reasonable assumptions about usage patterns based on the codebase
- Keep it concise but informative - aim for 3 paragraphs, ~10 lines total
- Use technical terminology appropriate for the project domain

The docstring should help a developer quickly understand the script's role and how it fits into the larger system.

Project codebase:
<project_code>
{{FULL_PROJECT_XML}}
</project_code>

Generate a docstring for this specific script:
<target_script>
{{SCRIPT_CONTENT}}
</target_script>
