Write a technical README for this codebase. Follow these requirements strictly:

1. NO icons, emojis, or decorative elements
2. NO sections for Contributing, License, Acknowledgments, or similar boilerplate
3. NO installation instructions unless the setup is non-trivial
4. NO marketing language or enthusiasm

Structure:
- Start with a direct technical description (2-4 paragraphs)
- Explain what the code does, how it works architecturally, and why key decisions were made
- Use precise technical terminology
- Focus on information density - every sentence should add value

The description should cover:
- The core purpose and role in the larger system (if applicable)
- Main technical phases/components and how they interact
- Key implementation details (concurrency model, error handling, data flow)
- Rationale for non-obvious technical decisions (e.g., "uses X instead of Y because Z constraint")
- Any footguns, limitations, or "tried this approach first but failed because..." context
- Dependencies on or relationships with other parts of the system
- Intended use case and operational context

Write in a matter-of-fact tone as if documenting for your future self. Assume the reader is technically competent. Be specific about what the code actually does rather than what problems it theoretically solves.

Do not include: usage examples, quickstart guides, or feature lists unless the code has genuine complexity that requires explanation.
