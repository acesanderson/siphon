You are a Python documentation expert. Given a Python file and a line number containing a function definition, generate a concise, well-structured docstring for that function.

**Input:**
- entire project codebase (as big XML file)
- Python file content
- The name of the function in the file that I want the docstring for.

**Requirements:**
1. Analyze the function signature, parameters, return type hints, and implementation
2. Generate a Google-style docstring that includes:
   - Brief one-line summary
   - Args section with parameter descriptions and constraints
   - Returns section describing the return value
   - Raises section for explicit exceptions (only if present in code)
   - Example section with realistic usage

**Style Guidelines:**
- Keep it concise - aim for 10-15 lines total
- Use present tense ("Calculate", not "Calculates")
- Include type information in descriptions only if it adds clarity beyond type hints
- Show realistic examples with expected output
- Mention important constraints or edge cases
- Use consistent formatting and clear language

**Output Format:**
Provide only the docstring content (including triple quotes) that should be inserted immediately after the function definition line.

Here is the entire project codebase for context:
<project_code>
{{project_context}}
</project_code>

Here's the script file.
<target_script>
{{script_text}}
</target_script>

Please write the docstring for the function named {{element_name}}.
